      <h1>Zachary Taylor</h1>
      <p><strong>Zachary Taylor</strong> (November 24, 1784 – July 9, 1850) was the 12th president of the United States, serving from March 1849 until his death in July 1850.</p>
      <p class="columns">Taylor previously was a career officer in the United States Army, rose to the rank of major general and became a national hero as a result of his victories in the Mexican–American War. As a result, he won election to the White House despite his vague political beliefs. His top priority as president was preserving the Union. He died sixteen months into his term, having made no progress on the most divisive issue in Congress, slavery. </p>

      <p> In June 1810, Taylor married Margaret Mackall Smith, whom he had met the previous autumn in Louisville. "Peggy" Smith came from a prominent family of Maryland planters—she was the daughter of Major Walter Smith, who had served in the Revolutionary War. The couple had <i>six children:</i></p>
      <ul>
         <li>Ann Mackall Taylor (1811–1875)</li>
         <li>Sarah Knox "Knoxie" Taylor (1814–1835)</li>
         <li>Octavia Pannell Taylor (1816–1820)</li>
         <li>Margaret Smith Taylor (1819–1820)</li>
         <li>Mary Elizabeth "Betty" Taylor (1824–1909)</li>
         <li>Richard Scott "Dick" Taylor (1826–1879)</li>
      </ul>
      <p> On July 4, 1850, Taylor reportedly consumed copious amounts of raw fruit and iced milk while attending holiday celebrations during a fund-raising event at the Washington Monument, which was then under construction. Over the course of several days, he became severely ill with an unknown digestive ailment. His doctor "diagnosed the illness as cholera morbus, a flexible mid-nineteenth-century term for intestinal ailments as diverse as diarrhea and dysentery but not related to Asiatic cholera", the latter being a widespread epidemic at the time of Taylor's death. The identity and source of Taylor's illness are the subject of historical speculation (see below), although it is known that several of his cabinet members had come down with a similar illness.Fever ensued and Taylor's chance of recovery was small.
        Despite treatment, Taylor died at 10:35 p.m. on July 9, 1850. He was 65 years old.[104] After his death, Vice President Fillmore assumed the presidency and completed Taylor's term, which ended on March 4, 1853.</p>
